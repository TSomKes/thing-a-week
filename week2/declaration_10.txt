The unanimous D9n of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
causes which impel them to the s8n.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain u9e Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to
secure these rights, G9s are i8d among Men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed,—That whenever any Form of
G8t becomes d9e of these ends, it is the Right of the
People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new G8t, laying
its f8n on such p8s and o8g its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that G9s long e9d should
not be changed for light and transient causes; and a9y all
e8e hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while
evils are s8e, than to right t8s by a8g the forms to
which they are a8d. But when a long train of abuses and
u9s, pursuing i8y the same Object evinces a design to
reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such G8t, and to provide new Guards for their future
security.—Such has been the patient s8e of these Colonies; and such
is now the necessity which c8s them to alter their former Systems
of G8t. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and u9s, all having in direct object
the e11t of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this,
let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
