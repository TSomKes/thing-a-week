thing-a-week
============

A series of small projects

This was inspired by Jonathan Coulton's "Thing a Week" experiment:  a public
attempt to create a series of songs on a deadline.  Though I don't think every
song that resulted was a masterpiece, there was some very, very good stuff in
there.  I assume that very good stuff wouldn't exist if it hadn't been for the
experiment.

I hope to do a bit of the same:  Do some things that are actually visible to
the world, and are (hopefully) occasionally interesting, or at least not
cripplingly embarrassing.
