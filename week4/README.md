Thing-a-Week, Week 3:  Name Generator
=====================================

Overview
--------
I've got a lot of projects in flight at once.  Or idling on the runway, or
rotting in the plane graveyard, or whatever.

On my machine, they're all hosted in directories under ~/code/, though they all
come from repos on either GitHub or BitBucket.  Some are Git repos, some are
Hg.

I often work offline, and I often work in short bursts on different projects.
Sometimes I forget which projects have local changes that haven't been pushed
back to the cloud.

I figured I should try to put together a little script to help me with that.
