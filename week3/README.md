Thing-a-Week, Week 3:  Name Generator
=====================================

Overview
--------
I figure I'll want a way to randomly generate first & last name combos for some
games I've thought about making.  I haven't made the games yet, but I can at
least play around with this bit.

As I picture this being a pretty simple read from a few different text files,
if it feels too simple it might turn into an exploration of working with
command line parameters in Python.

Example
-------
Like it says on the tin:

> F Emily Shakespeare
> M Ed Bergman
> M Truman Roosevelt
> M Albert Churchill
> F Hellen Bergman
> M Upton Travolta
> F Amelia Frank
> M Uwe Ball
> F Ingrid Keller
> F Sally Andrews
